About:

Mo'Controls allows the player to have a primary and secondary input for each in-game control,
the player could set all primary inputs to the keyboard and all secondary inputs to an Xbox 
Controller to have a seamless swap of the keyboard to Xbox Controller. Mo'Controls also allows
the player to have different control profiles for when on foot and when in driving mode! So
you can get more out of your controller!

# Default key to toggle the GUI is Home or hold down the back button on a connected xbox controller. (>0.5sec)
# Force feedback on an Xbox controller! 
Modes:
    	default (toplessgun)
	rpm limiter,
 	wheel slip,
 	gear change
# Mouse emulation on an Xbox controller!
# Split Control Profiles
- Two separate control groups, 'Foot controls' and 'Driving controls'. Both groups contain all controls but one group is used while on-foot and the other, well, while driving.
# Hold 'Start' (Xbox controller) for 3seconds to toggle tool-mode and use the triggers to screw in bolts!
# Implemented detect scrollable logic =>

Mo'Controls aim is to allow a user to play the game with only an Xbox controller. It is almost there, with most core logic done (xbox api, keyboard and mouse emulation done), There is only few more things to implement to make this happen
I plan on implementing some kind of pie-wheel GUI for selecting certain keyboard actions, such as: talking, pushing, punching.. eg. - This would free up alot of button assignments on the controller.
I also plan on implementing some type auto-detect when mousing over an object in-game that has an action with mouse scrolling.
This would make it rather  seemless to be able to just use mouse over the window handle and use it.
Need to also implement catalogue interaction, as once you click on that parts catalogue, it's back to the keyboard.

Thanks to all the people who support and appreciate the project.

Cheers -Tommee J. Armytage.
